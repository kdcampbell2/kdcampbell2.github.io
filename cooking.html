				Albeit, I’m absolutely mingen when it comes to cooking, hey, everyone’s gotta start somewhere, right? Someone who’s served as an absolute inspiration for the “do it as you go, make mistakes (a lot of them at that), and you’re going in the right direction. Brad Leone, Test Kitchen Manager at Bon Appetit and star of It’s Alive with Brad on YouTube, is exactly that person. His approach to cooking is one of experimentation, adventure and a little fire along the way. One of my favorite books of his is Field Notes for Food Adventure and It's it's served as a culinary guide for success but mainly failure; but hey, that's what helps you learn at the end of the day anyways.</p>

				Following my stay at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I plan on attending medical school and eventually opening up my own practice. Where I'll be attending mecical school is up for grabs at the moment (mainly whoever want's me will have their offer entertained at the end of the day). Once I've got more free time down the road (of which will be in a long time most likely), I'd like to purchase some land here in Wisconsin, preferably in the driftless area. A log cabin with a couple of dogs and whoever I find along the way doesn't sound too bad to me; who knowns, but the journey i've been on so far is quite fun regardless.  </p>

				Currently Kellan is a student researcher for <a href="https://neurology.wisc.edu/research-and-labs/gallagher-lab/"> the Gallagher Lab </a> at the William S. Middleton Veterans Hospital in the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. He is helping with the development and use of brain imaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and related neurodegenerative disorders. Current studies aim to identify preclinical markers for Parkinson's disease in Veterans with sleep disorders. Some of the studies he's helped with are detailed below. </p>

			<h3> Average Slope of Reginoal Cerbral Perfusion Changes with Age </h3>
			<p>  "Greater White Matter Hyperintensity within the bilateral precentral and left postcentral gyri white matter was associated with higher (more abnormal) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores at baseline. In Parkinsons Disease subjects, greater longitudinal increase in total WMH volume was associated with greater increases in UPDRS motor sub-scores". <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6543018/"> Source. </a>

				<h3> White Matter Hyperintensity Probability Maps </h3>
				<p> "APOE-genotype and sex interactively impact cerebral perfusion-trajectories in mid- to late-life. This effect may be partially explained by cardiometabolic alterations". <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8545048/"> Source. </a>
